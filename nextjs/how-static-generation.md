# how to determine if your Next.js project uses Static Generation, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the `pages` directory:**
   Static Generation in Next.js is typically implemented in the `pages` directory. Look for files that use the `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` functions.

2. **Inspect individual page files:**
   Open the `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` files in the `pages` directory. Look for the following:

   - **getStaticProps**: This function is used to pre-render pages at build time. If you see this function in a page file, it indicates that the page uses Static Generation.

     ```javascript
     export async function getStaticProps(context) {
       // Fetch data or perform other operations
       return {
         props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
       };
     }
     ```

   - **getStaticPaths**: This function is used for dynamic routes and is often used in conjunction with `getStaticProps`. If you see this function, it also indicates Static Generation for dynamic routes.

     ```javascript
     export async function getStaticPaths() {
       // Generate paths for dynamic routes
       return {
         paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],
         fallback: false, // or true, or 'blocking'
       };
     }
     ```

3. **Check the `next.config.js` file:**
   While not directly related to Static Generation, the `next.config.js` file might contain settings that affect how Static Generation is used, such as `output: 'export'` for fully static exports.

4. **Build output:**
   After running `next build`, check the output. If you see messages about generating static pages, it's a good indication that Static Generation is being used.

5. **Deployment and hosting:**
   If your project is deployed to a static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages, it's likely using Static Generation.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine if your Next.js project uses Static Generation. If you find `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` in your page files, it's a clear sign that Static Generation is being utilized.
