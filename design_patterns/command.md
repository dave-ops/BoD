# The Command Pattern 
this is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters. It also supports undoable operations.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Command Pattern, followed by a Python implementation:

1. **Command Interface**: Defines the interface for executing an operation.

2. **Concrete Command**: Implements the Command interface and binds a receiver object to an action.

3. **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request.

4. **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request.

5. **Client**: Creates a concrete command object and sets its receiver.

Let's implement this pattern in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Command Interface
class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self):
        pass

# Concrete Command
class LightOnCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, light):
        self.light = light

    def execute(self):
        self.light.turn_on()

class LightOffCommand(Command):
    def __init__(self, light):
        self.light = light

    def execute(self):
        self.light.turn_off()

# Receiver
class Light:
    def turn_on(self):
        print("Light is ON")

    def turn_off(self):
        print("Light is OFF")

# Invoker
class RemoteControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.command = None

    def set_command(self, command):
        self.command = command

    def press_button(self):
        if self.command:
            self.command.execute()
        else:
            print("No command set")

# Client
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create receiver
    living_room_light = Light()

    # Create concrete commands
    light_on = LightOnCommand(living_room_light)
    light_off = LightOffCommand(living_room_light)

    # Create invoker
    remote = RemoteControl()

    # Use the remote to turn on the light
    remote.set_command(light_on)
    remote.press_button()  # Output: Light is ON

    # Use the remote to turn off the light
    remote.set_command(light_off)
    remote.press_button()  # Output: Light is OFF

```



In this example:

- `Command` is the abstract base class defining the `execute` method.
- `LightOnCommand` and `LightOffCommand` are concrete commands that implement the `execute` method and are associated with a `Light` receiver.
- `Light` is the receiver that knows how to perform the operations (turn on/off).
- `RemoteControl` is the invoker that asks the command to carry out the request.
- The client code creates the objects and sets up the commands.

This pattern allows for easy extension (e.g., adding new commands like `DimLightCommand`) and supports features like undo operations or macro commands (sequences of commands).
